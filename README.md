# CodeAlpha_DataAnalyticsProject
📘 CodeAlpha Data Analytics Internship
🧩 Task: Web Scraping & Data Visualization using Python

Author: Roshan

🗂️ Project Overview

This project was completed as part of the CodeAlpha Data Analytics Internship.
It involves two key components:

Web Scraping: Extracting book data (title, price, and rating) from the website Books to Scrape
.

Data Visualization: Creating meaningful charts to analyze trends and insights from the collected data.

⚙️ Tech Stack & Tools

🐍 Python

📊 Pandas

🌐 BeautifulSoup (for web scraping)

🎨 Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)

💻 Jupyter Notebook

📈 Project Workflow

Web Scraping (web_scraping.ipynb)

Extracted book titles, prices, and ratings from multiple pages.

Cleaned and stored data in a CSV file (books_data.csv).

Data Visualization (data_visualization.ipynb)

Analyzed the scraped dataset.

Visualized price distributions, rating counts, and top 10 expensive books.

Derived key insights using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

📊 Key Insights

Most books are priced under £40.

Books with 4–5 star ratings tend to have slightly higher prices.

The dataset has a right-skewed price distribution.

Top 10 expensive books can be targeted for deeper marketing analysis.

🚀 How to Run the Project
# Install required libraries
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn beautifulsoup4 requests

# Run in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab

🧾 Output Files

books_data.csv → Scraped dataset

Graphs displayed in data_visualization.ipynb

🎯 Conclusion

This project demonstrates end-to-end data collection and analysis —
from scraping live web data to creating visual insights using Python tools.
